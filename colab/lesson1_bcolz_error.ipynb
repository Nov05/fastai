But the competition resulted in a huge jump to 98.9% accuracy, with the author of a popular deep learning library winning the competition. Extraordinarily, less than 4 years later, we can now beat that result in seconds! Even last year in this same course, our initial model had 98.3% accuracy, which is nearly double the error we're getting just a year later, and that took around 10 minutes to compute."
